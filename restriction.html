                    <p class="container--centered container--margin-top-48px text--spaced"><i>Restriction</i> is a collaboration between Philipp Rothkirch and I, as an attempt to unite classical and contemporary music through the exploration of different tuning systems. It is performed by Oscar Richardson (piano).
                    </p>
                    <p class="container--centered container--margin-top-48px text--spaced">For <i>Restriction</i> I decided to create and tune a MIDI instrument that allowed the user to change tuning system when desired. These tuning systems include conventional ones such as Pythagorean, Quarter Comma Meantone and Just Intonation,
                        but also feature alternative ideas of tuning such as tuning by ‘major and minor semitones’, simple microtonal tuning (an octave tuned to a tritone), or tuning certain notes in the scale down by 50 cents. I would like to clarify
                        that we wrote this piece when I had little knowledge of experimental tuning systems, and I have learned more since.</p>
                    <p class="container--centered container--margin-top-48px text--spaced">The clash of styles is definitely evident in the piece; Philipp’s parts take on Pythagorean, Quarter Comma and Just Intonation and focus on the best sounding intervals within these, using classical and romantic styles. My parts act
                        more as a study of the capabilities of each system while avoiding stylistic limitation.</p>
                    <p class="container--centered container--margin-top-48px text--spaced">The piece follows a narrative of being restricted by society; this mirrors the tuning systems (and limitations within) becoming more ‘restricted’. However, there is also a hint of freedom, portrayed especially in the final microtonal
                        canon. It seems that in the microtonal canon any melodic or harmonic ‘restrictions’ in notation become ignored and even opposed by the music with its number of notes per octaves. This, therefore, allows restriction to be avoided
                        by ignoring and opposing the system itself, even if the character still feels trapped and cynical.
                    </p>
