                </h1>
                <p class="container--margin-horizontal-20px text--centered text--bold">(25/08/2020)</p>
                <div class="container--fixed-width-90 container--centered">
                    <p class="container--centered container--margin-top-48px text--spaced">There’s something quite special about women shouting about supermarkets and not giving a shit. There’s also something quite special about contemporary experimental music, that’s really been thought through, and you’re probably not
                        supposed to giggle at.</p>
                    <p class="container--centered container--margin-top-48px text--spaced">Slop pop and contemporary experimental music typically don’t mix. Of course, it tends to be that popular music and art music don’t mix often in general, possibly due to the fact that the latter often refuses to acknowledge itself as
                        a commodity. However on a personal level, what really stands out with these genres is the perceived carelessness of slop pop and punk in contrast with the seriousness of contemporary music. For those not familiar with slop pop,
                        I’d recommend listening to the band Diet Cig as they were the primary influence here (I’m also a bit of a superfan).</p>
                    <p class="container--centered container--margin-top-48px text--spaced">My general approach with this EP was to link pop tracks with contemporary music interludes in order to display them in harmony, while allowing them to retain their character. I also decided to link them directly, so that they had to
                        be listened to as one, as I like the idea of challenging popular and contemporary music discourse and forcing both to be acknowledged and (hopefully) valued. Though two of the tracks on the EP are indie rather than slop pop, I
                        still was able to enhance this perceived messiness and carelessness in <i>Oscar</i> and <i>David Gandy</i> to make the contrast apparent.
                    </p>
                    <p class="container--centered container--margin-top-48px text--spaced">Very little explanation is needed for the pop (and lo-fi hip hop) tracks on this album; they exist to be enjoyed as they are. However, I would like to go into more detail on the contemporary tracks:</p>
                    <h2 class="container--margin-top-48px text--20px">ASMR interlude</h2>
                    <p class="container--centered container--margin-top-48px text--spaced">The idea for this track came from my admiration for Holly Herndon sticking an ASMR track (<i>Lonely at the Top</i>) in the middle of her album <i>Platform</i>. Unlike Herndon, I lacked the guts to make mine very extensive, and ended
                        up cramming ASMR triggers into 30 seconds, mainly because I wanted to maintain consistency; however, this did become an interesting challenge for me. I decided to explore my ASMR recordings through granular synthesis and make more
                        of some of the tiny fragments I had. For example, the water sound at the start comes from a short recording of me pouring a cup of tea. Using a granular synth also meant I was able to create some sustained pitched sounds from spoken
                        ASMR parts that led to some nice vocal layers and a smooth transition into <i>It's Not Me, It's You</i>.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="container--margin-top-48px text--20px">Just Intonation interlude</h2>
                    <p class="container--centered container--margin-top-48px text--spaced">This interlude is another experiment with the Max patch that I used for my piece
                        <i><a class="a--blue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="perfection-distortion-expansion">Perfection, Distortion, Expansion</a></i>, this time mainly focusing on the perfection part. The patch functions by instructing
                        a vocalist to sing in a certain way, then manipulates their vocals in real-time based on their responses, to achieve chords, melodies and glissandi using alternative tuning. I decided to exploit the features that could achieve
                        'perfect' tuning of an interval (Just Intonation). This occurs in a harmonic context (at the start) and a melodic context (at the end). Interestingly, the melodic ideas at the end were not a choice of my own and were actually generated
                        by the patch.
                    </p>
                    <p class="container--centered container--margin-top-48px text--spaced">I found this interlude particularly challenging because, due to the Just Intonation aspect and random generative nature of the patch, I had to leave the texture very sparse (as otherwise, Just Intonation would not have been achieved).
                        However, I find it quite peaceful to listen to and I would like to explore alternative tuning systems as a more significant part of a project in the future.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="container--margin-top-48px text--20px">A reverb tail</h2>
                    <p class="container--centered container--margin-top-48px container--margin-bottom-48px text--spaced">The idea for this interlude emerged when I noticed that <i>Photo Day</i> had a fairly long reverb tail. I decided to extend this further by adding and automating two different reverbs (that emphasise different frequencies) to the last
                        note of <i>Photo Day</i>. I then used samples of this reverb either tuned differently or put through a granular synth. So it’s basically a tiny bit of sound, and a lot of imaginary space.
