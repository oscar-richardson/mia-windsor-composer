                        <p class="container--centered container--margin-top-48px text--spaced"><i>Perfection, distortion, expansion</i> is a generative Max MSP patch that creates a piece of music for a solo voice, to be performed in real-time, that extends beyond a solo singer or even a choir’s capabilities. The patch instructs a vocalist to sing in a certain way, manipulates these vocals and then changes the instruction, based on the singer’s actions and random numbers generated by the patch. The primary strategy with the piece was to create sounds that would be typically unachievable for a vocalist, due to the levels of precision involved. The piece, therefore, makes use of just intonation in a melodic and harmonic context (with single intervals) and contrasts this with distortions such as beating, and more dissonant four-note chords, that do not always sum up in just intonation. Single notes are sometimes expanded in length with delay to enable the patch to ‘sing’ for longer, which also can create interesting rhythmic and modulation effects. The patch can also turn a single sustained note into multiple notes by generating a melody or a glissando.</p>
                        <p class="container--centered container--margin-top-48px text--spaced">The input vocal has been left out in this particular recording, to display the sonic effects created by the patch. However, when performed live in front of an audience, the input vocal will be heard but not amplified. The input pitch is actually evident in every chordal and beating outcome in the patch (excluding when glissandi are generated by the patch and not the performer).</p>
